1::: Tree at my window, window tree,
2::: My sash is lowered when night comes on;
3::: But let there never be curtain drawn
4::: Between you and me.
5::: 
6::: Vague dream-head lifted out of the ground,
7::: And thing next most diffuse to cloud,
8::: Not all your light tongues talking aloud
9::: Could be profound.
10::: 
11::: But tree, I have seen you taken and tossed,
12::: And if you have seen me when I slept,
13::: You have seen me when I was taken and swept
14::: And all but lost.
15::: 
16::: That day she put our heads together,
17::: Fate had her imagination about her,
18::: Your head so much concerned with outer,
19::: Mine with inner, weather.
